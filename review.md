## Completed Work

- Implemented category paging using Swiper where **each swipe moves 6 categories** (1 slide = 6 items) while keeping the existing category item markup/classes unchanged.

## What was implemented

- `src/components/sections/CategoriesSection.jsx`
  - Added Swiper wrapper that chunks categories into pages of `pageSize` (default **6**).
  - Kept the same grid classes (`gridCols`) and the same item UI.
  - Disabled touch move when categories are \(\le 6\) to preserve the “static grid” feel.
- `src/components/sections/CategoriesSectionHome2.jsx`
  - Same approach as above, with the Home2 category item design preserved.

## Screen Integration Status

### Home Screen (`src/pages/Home.jsx`)

#### Connected
- Categories UI: `CategoriesSection` (now Swiper-paged, 6 per swipe)

#### Remaining
- None for the category pager behavior.

### Home2 Screen (`src/pages/Home2.jsx`)

#### Connected
- Categories UI: `CategoriesSectionHome2` (now Swiper-paged, 6 per swipe)

#### Remaining
- None for the category pager behavior.

### Header / Navigation (`src/components/layout/Navigation.jsx`)

#### Connected
- Desktop navigation categories are now Swiper-paged (6 links per swipe)

#### Remaining
- None for the navigation pager behavior.

## Notes / Verification

- `npm run build` succeeds.
- `npm run lint` was failing previously due to multiple existing repo-wide issues; it now runs but reports existing errors/warnings across unrelated files.
- Updated `vite.config.js` dev proxy to route `/api/*` to `https://kids.nodeteam.site` so local dev uses the remote backend.
- Updated Kids home categories section to show **5 per swipe** (Swiper paging) instead of 6.
- Prevented broken image icon when a category has no `image` URL (keeps the circle background intact).
- Updated Home2 categories section to show **5 per swipe** (Swiper paging) and prevented broken image icons when `image` is missing.
- Added small left/right navigation arrows (desktop) to the category Swipers so users can click to move between pages.
- Added small left/right navigation arrows (desktop) to the header navigation categories Swiper (`Navigation.jsx`).
- Hide the arrow when it is disabled (first/last page) so users understand which direction is available.
- Fixed category pages with large product counts by fetching all backend pages (backend defaults to paginated responses with limit=50 and max=100).
- Enabled internal scrolling for the dashboard sidebar menu so long lists remain accessible.
- Admin dashboard: added category filter to products list and debounced search input to avoid refetching on each keystroke.
- Enabled Swiper autoplay for category sections and header navigation (auto-advance between pages).
